**House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**  

This project predicts house prices using regression techniques, following the **Data Science Life Cycle**:  
- **Data Preparation**: Collected, cleaned, and visualized data with Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
- **Model Building**: Developed regression models to analyze and predict housing prices based on provided features.  
- **Evaluation**: Used train-test split methods to ensure accurate performance evaluation and robust predictions.  

The project highlights a structured and optimized approach to predictive modeling with an emphasis on data-driven insights.
